What is Python language?
Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.Its design
philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer
lines of code than possible in
languages such as C++ or Java.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional
programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and has a large and comprehensive standard library.The best way we learn anything is by practice and
exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with
Python.
